This add on to the Block Editor Customiser allows the hiding of blocks in the Editor.
Please be aware it is possible to make them visible again if the user has access to the 'Show more tools and options'
menu where they can select the 'Block Manager' to reactivate the blocks hidden by this addon.

If you do not want this to happen the only way of preventing it is to hide the 'Show more tools and options' which can
be done from the main settings page in the Block Editor Customiser.

If you want to deactivate or uninstall this add on, then please uncheck all block types that have
been checked, save the changes, and open a post or page before deactivation, otherwise any block types that have
been previously hidden will remain hidden unless displayed using the 'Block Manager' mentioned above.
